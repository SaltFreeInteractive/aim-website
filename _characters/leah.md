Leah Pines used to work in the forest service for Blossom Island National Parks. She loves the outdoors, wilderness, mountains and spending many nights out camping. Leah is a very quiet girl who spends much time journaling while staring off into the beautiful sunset. Sadly her peaceful nights working as a park ranger were interrupted by C.L.A.W. forces. Using her knowledge of the land and applying her survival skills, she was able to evade and stay undetected. Leah soon found herself alone in the woods surviving for weeks until encountering additional survivors trying to take refuge from C.L.A.W. units. Soon enough Leah encountered A.I.M. forces and was promoted to commander due to her vast knowledge of the forests on Blossom Island. Leah primarily focuses on long range combat, reconnaissance, and covert operations, spending days out on missions keeping an eye on C.L.A.W.
