Diana Engel is a child prodigy. She entered Blossom Island’s School of Medicine at a young age and graduated at the age of 18. It wasn’t long until she was recruited to work as a surgeon in the emergency rooms. Diana was mid operation when C.L.A.W. forces made their strike. Diana and her head nurse were able to evacuate the hospital and found safety moments before destruction. Eventually Diana was able to regroup with many other survivors of Blossom Island and joined A.I.M. With her experience in medicine, Diana was quickly promoted to be a commander and joined her allies on the field to fight against C.L.A.W. Diana is extremely shy, nervous, and fumbles a lot as a commander. Her experience with weapons and combat are zero to none and primarily focuses on the health and safety of her soldiers.
