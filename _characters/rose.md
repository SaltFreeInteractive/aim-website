Rose Toge was a <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> of Blossom Island. Unhappy with how the government and state of affairs operated, she resigned to take matters into her own hands. After many years Rose managed to form a Private Militray Contract group named C.L.A.W. (Counter Logistics Animal Warfare) to take matters into her own hands and make changes to Blossom Island that she deems fit. Rose managed to swiftly conquer and take the island by surprise with her connections as a <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span>. Fighting alongside Rose includes<span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span>, a fox who specializes in pyrotechnics and <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> a <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> puma <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> that was <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> affectionate in her interrogation methods. Little is known of Rose's true intentions for Blossom Island, but what is known is enough to have galvanized the Island's residents and A.I.M. into protecting their home and loved ones from C.L.A.W.
