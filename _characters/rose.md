Rose Toge was a <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> chief of Blossom Island. Unhappy with how the government and state of affairs operated she resigned to take matters into her own hands. Throughout many years Rose managed to form a PMC group named C.L.A.W. (Counter Logistics Animal Warfare) to take matters into her own hands and make a change to Blossom Island that she deems fit. Rose managed to swiftly conquer and take the island by surprise with her connections as a <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> chief. Fighting alongside Rose includes an <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span>, a fox who specializes in pyrotechnics and <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> a <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> puma <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> that was <span class="redacted">[ REDACTED ]</span> affectionate in her interrogation methods. Roseâ€™s goal is currently unknown but the only thing that stands in her way of completely taking control of Blossom Island is A.I.M. However the residents of the island will not give in that easily in protecting their home and loved ones from C.L.A.W.
